Graph Traversal: An interactive graph visualizer that allows you to explore graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra) step by step with animated, hand-drawn style nodes and edges.

Features: Generate random graphs. Generate random graphs with weighted edges. Visualize BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra traversals. Step-by-step algorithm logs. Sketchy, animated SVG nodes and edges with hand-drawn fonts. Toggle panels for controls and logs.

Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SVG for graph visualization, TailwindCSS for styling

How to Run: Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Batool-Suleiman/graph-traversal.git, Open index.html in your browser.
